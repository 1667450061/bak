#################################
ETF Driver v002
#################################
- Changes etf_drivers/Makefile so that modifications are no more needed in SI
	before compiling ETF application and drivers. Although before building,
	make sure to do lunch <...-eng> command first.
- Added ioctl IOCTL_ST90TDS_CHIP_VERSION to detect chip version before loading
	firmware

#################################
ETF Driver v001
#################################
- Moves etf_drivers folder out of retf/petf/uetf directory so that single
	etf_drivers source code is used for all 3 flavors
- Combines folders drv_etf_ioctl and test_sdio so that instead of the earlier
	2 drivers (viz. drv_etf_ioctl and test_sdio), only a single etf driver
	 (named etf_driver.ko) is created
- Replaces UMAC/UMI prefixed functions and identifiers to start with ETF
- Removes WORKAROUND & FIRMWARE_FILE macro and related code since it is redundant
- Support for PETF API sleepstatus to find sleep status of device


#################################
ETF Driver v0.1 (since RETF v009)
#################################
- Change logic of reading GPIO pins
- Compilation now moved to <Release>/kernel/drivers/etf_drivers from the earlier
	<Release>/vendor/â€¦/cw1200/etf_drivers
- Removed dependency of function u8500_sdio_detect_card() and used
	cw1200_detect_card() instead for mmc card scan
- Chip detection logic changed, new code detects CW1250 cut1.1 also
- The ETF drivers can run in any of the 3 flavours viz. RETF, PETF and UETF using
	etf_flavour argument during insmod
- Adds dynamic log support:  insmod etf_driver.ko debug_level=<dbg_num>
- Code formatted and warnings removed
